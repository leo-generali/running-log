- 7' warmup drills
- Very very easy pace running
- 10' cooldown drills

Feeling much much better compared to the last few runs. Ankle is getting significantly less stiffer after each run. I wonder if all those calf drills while I was working on my achilles did something to it. 

Little bit rainy today, not as nice as I would have liked. 10 miles this week so far with 5 lined up for Sunday. It'll probably be hard but that's basically every run at this point...
