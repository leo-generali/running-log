- 10’ warmup drills
- 5.ish miles
- 10’ cooldown drills

Felt like absolute garbage this run... not surprising to anyone considering that I'm in the middle of getting back into shape and I decided to go for my longest run in a literal month in 85 degree weather. Stopped 2 or 3 times, can't even remember.

Got home and basically died on the floor for a little bit, but I buckled down and did my drills and stretches - even if didn't want to. I think I might go for 5 tomorrow. Still trying to decide if I should do 15 this coming week or 20. Decisions decisions.
