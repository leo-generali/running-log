10’ warmup drills
4 miles
15’ cooldown drills

Gonna stick to 1️⃣5️⃣ miles per week for now. No rush to get into fitness and I want to stay on the healthy side of running. Maybe at the end of next week we might think of moving to the big 1️⃣9️⃣. Tbd!

Lots of people out and about today. Oh how nice it must be to be a student without classes just straight up chilling in AA. Your only obligation is how much beer you can consume and how much floating on the inner tube you can do in one week.
